        I'm a tech enthusiast who loves nothing more than using innovative tools
        to build something from scratch. I've been doing it since I was a kid,
        starting with simple websites and text adventure games. Now I have
        experience in a wide range of technologies and countless projects under
        my belt.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I value most in software development is cooperation and shared
        understanding. I believe that working together and keeping the bigger
        picture in mind is essential for success. That's why I'm always
        available to discuss, brainstorm new ideas and answer questions. I'm not
        afraid to step outside my comfort zone to gain a deeper understanding of
        the task at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my girlfriend and our
        furry friend, or hanging out with friends and family. I'm also an avid
        reader of scientific articles and tech-blogs that inspire me to turn
        ideas into coding projects. You might find me running a race or hitting
        the dog park on a sunny weekend.

      Worked as a full stack developer on a web application for alarm centers
      for one of Svep's clients. This project involved a great deal of
      refactoring of the codebase and implementing an ever changing set of
      requirements. When mere seconds can determine life or death, a lot of
      effort has to be put in making sure that the operators are able to work as
      effectively as possible. This type of system has to be performant and
      fault tolerant. Our team consisted of me, one colleague from Neodev and
      four Svep employees. We worked closely with Svep's client in order to
      integrate our platform with their legacy systems.

      - and won! Our idea was to create a virtual meeting moderator that uses AI
      to distinguish who is speaking and display statistics on a dashboard in
      real time. We managed to implement a prototype which we live-demoed during
      the final presentation. Future development includes detecting over-talking
      and aggressive speaking. My contributions were mainly to the backend and
      machine learning based voice recognition.

      After graduating from Lund's University I decided to dedicate three months
      to trading on the stock market. The main goal of the project was to beat a
      benchmark index (OMXS30), which was successfully accomplished. Firstly, an
      automated data collection system was created. Forums, financial websites
      and APIs were frequently scraped and the data added to a database.
      Thereafter, the data was analyzed using various models, one of which a KNN
      (see link below). In addition to beating the benchmark, one other goal of
      the project was to only trade systematically. Meaning that all the buy and
      sell decisions would be made by algorithms without human interference.
      This was not accomplished due to the time constraint. Instead, I made all
      the trading decisions using charts and the models' outputs. [Python,

      My principal task was to create and maintain automated routines which make
      up a large part of the day to day operations of the bank. This was done
      through robotic process automation (RPA). The automation included
      everything from the verification of applicants' documents, generating and
      sending documents to the clients, paying out loans, to name a few.
      Furthermore, I also developed a lot of in-house tooling and systems. One
      of these systems became the core of all the automation and is to this day
      responsible for the routing of tasks to worker nodes and task life-cycle
      management.

      Our bachelor thesis consisted in analyzing the performance of various
      machine learning models on the prediction of local minimums and maximums
      in the historical price data of stocks in the S&P 500 composite index. The
      results showed that deep neural networks easily outperformed classical
      models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and the K-Nearest Neighbors
      algorithm (KNN). With the recurrent neural network ‚ÄúLong short-term
      memory‚Äù (LSTM) coming out on top.
