        Although I am at the beginning of my professional career, I have been
        programming since I was 12 years old. It all began with simple websites
        and text adventure games. I liked the challenge of learning new
        technologies and using them to build cool projects. Today, the only
        thing that has changed is the amount of experience I have. I've
        programmed in over a dozen languages in countless projects. Thanks to my
        broad knowledge, I am able to learn new technologies quickly and start
        providing value.

        My belief is that cooperation and shared understanding are the most
        important factors in software development. Too often have I seen
        different departments have simple misunderstandings which result in
        wasted time and resources. I am therefore always available to discuss
        new ideas and answer questions. I also like to make an effort to
        understand parts of the system that are outside my scope, but that might
        give me a better understanding of the system as a whole.

        Outside of work I like spending time together with my girlfriend and
        puppy or friends and family. I also enjoy reading scientific articles.
        The most captivating of these I might implement in code, share on GitHub
        and then blog about them. I find it relaxing and a good opportunity to
        learn new skills. Finally, I am also a running fanatic and like racing
        and going for runs with friends, colleagues and/or my dog.

        Full-Stack developer at Svep Design Center
      </h3>
      <p>
        Worked as a full stack developer on a web application for alarm centers
        for one of Svep's clients. This project involved a great deal of
        refactoring of the codebase and implementing an ever changing set of
        requirements. When mere seconds can determine life or death, a lot of
        effort has to be put in making sure that the operators are able to work
        as effectively as possible. This type of system has to be performant and
        fault tolerant. Our team consisted of me, one colleague from Neodev and
        four Svep employees. We worked closely with Svep's client in order to
        integrate our platform with their legacy systems.

        - and won! Our idea was to create a virtual meeting moderator that uses
        AI to distinguish who is speaking and display statistics on a dashboard
        in real time. We managed to implement a prototype which we live-demoed
        during the final presentation. Future development includes detecting
        over-talking and aggressive speaking. My contributions were mainly to
        the backend and machine learning based voice recognition.

        Quantitative Trading
      </h3>
      <p>
        After graduating from Lund's University I decided to dedicate three
        months to trading on the stock market. The main goal of the project was
        to beat a benchmark index (OMXS30), which was successfully accomplished.
        Firstly, an automated data collection system was created. Forums,
        financial websites and APIs were frequently scraped and the data added
        to a database. Thereafter, the data was analyzed using various models,
        one of which a KNN (see link below). In addition to beating the
        benchmark, one other goal of the project was to only trade
        systematically. Meaning that all the buy and sell decisions would be
        made by algorithms without human interference. This was not accomplished
        due to the time constraint. Instead, I made all the trading decisions
        using charts and the models' outputs.

        My principal task was to create and maintain automated routines which
        make up a large part of the day to day operations of the bank. This was
        done through robotic process automation (RPA). The automation included
        everything from the verification of applicants' documents, generating
        and sending documents to the clients, paying out loans, to name a few.
        Furthermore, I also developed a lot of in-house tooling and systems. One
        of these systems became the core of all the automation and is to this
        day responsible for the routing of tasks to worker nodes and task
        life-cycle management.

        Our bachelor thesis consisted in analyzing the performance of various
        machine learning models on the prediction of local minimums and maximums
        in the historical price data of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 composite
        index. The results showed that deep neural networks easily outperformed
        classical models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and the K-Nearest
        Neighbors algorithm (KNN). With the recurrent neural network ‚ÄúLong
        short-term memory‚Äù (LSTM) coming out on top.

        Project leader ‚ÄúSoftware development for large projects‚Äù-course
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of the courses I took during my studies was software development for
        large projects. A team consisting of 20 students had to develop a system
        for a fictional client. My role was that of the project leader. This
        entailed scheduling and holding meetings, making high level decisions
        and delegating work to the two subgroups; development and testing.
        Although client satisfaction was the top priority, I also prioritized
        making sure that everybody in the team was happy and productive. We
        managed to deliver a fully functioning system and the client was
        satisfied.

        One of the courses I took during my studies was simply called ‚ÄúProject
        3rd year‚Äù. The goal of this course was to create and deliver a piece of
        software to a company in the private sector. My group had the pleasure
        to work with Fenix Solar - a new startup with the mission to make owning
        solar panels hassle free. Fenix Solar needed a platform on which the
        staff and external contractors could monitor the performance of the
        clients' photovoltaic system. The project model chosen was scrum and my
        role was that of the technical leader. My contribution was the frontend
        javascript, the python backend and database.
