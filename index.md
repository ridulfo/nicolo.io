Check out my [Blog üìù](https://blog.nicolo.io) !

Although I am at the beginning of my professional career, I have been programming since I was 12 years old. It all began with simple websites and text adventure games. I liked the challenge of learning new technologies and using them to build cool projects. Today, the only thing that has changed is the amount of experience I have. I‚Äôve programmed in over a dozen languages in countless projects. Thanks to my broad knowledge, I am able to learn new technologies quickly and start providing value.

My belief is that cooperation and shared understanding are the most important factors in software development. Too often have I seen different departments have simple misunderstandings which result in wasted time and resources. I am therefore always available to discuss new ideas and answer questions. I also like to make an effort to understand parts of the system that are outside my scope, but that might give me a better understanding of the system as a whole.

Outside of work I like spending time together with my girlfriend and puppy or friends and family. I also enjoy reading scientific articles. The most captivating of these I might implement in code, share on GitHub and then blog about them. I find it relaxing and a good opportunity to learn new skills. Finally, I am also a running fanatic and like racing and going for runs with friends, colleagues and/or my dog.

## Assignments/Project Experience

### 2021 Oct - 2022 Jun Full-Stack developer at Svep Design Center

Worked as a full stack developer on a web application for alarm centers for one of Svep‚Äôs clients. This project involved a great deal of refactoring of the codebase and implementing an ever changing set of requirements. When mere seconds can determine life or death, a lot of effort has to be put in making sure that the operators are able to work as effectively as possible. This type of system has to be performant and fault tolerant. Our team consisted of me, one colleague from Neodev and four Svep employees. We worked closely with Svep‚Äôs client in order to integrate our platform with their legacy systems.

### 2021 Dec Winners of ‚ÄúHACTathon: AI for Gender Equality‚Äù

Me and four other colleagues participated in [this hackathon](https://www.vinnova.se/en/events-calendar/2020/12/hactathon-ai-for-gender-equality/) and won. Our idea was to create a virtual meeting moderator that uses AI to distinguish who is speaking and display statistics on a dashboard in real time. We managed to implement a prototype which we live-demoed during the final presentation. Future development includes detecting over-talking and aggressive speaking. My contributions were mainly to the backend and machine learning based voice recognition.

### 2021 Jun - sept Quantitative Trading

After graduating from Lund‚Äôs University I decided to dedicate three months to trading on the stock market. The main goal of the project was to beat a benchmark index (OMXS30), which was successfully accomplished. Firstly, an automated data collection system was created. Forums, financial websites and APIs were frequently scraped and the data added to a database. Thereafter, the data was analyzed using various models, one of which a KNN (see link below). In addition to beating the benchmark, one other goal of the project was to only trade systematically. Meaning that all the buy and sell decisions would be made by algorithms without human interference. This was not accomplished due to the time constraint. Instead, I made all the trading decisions using charts and the models‚Äô outputs.

### 2019-2021 L√•n och Spar Bank Sverige: Developer

My principal task was to create and maintain automated routines which make up a large part of the day to day operations of the bank. This was done through robotic process automation (RPA). The automation included everything from the verification of applicants‚Äô documents, generating and sending documents to the clients, paying out loans, to name a few. Furthermore, I also developed a lot of in-house tooling and systems. One of these systems became the core of all the automation and is to this day responsable for the routing of tasks to worker nodes and task life-cycle management.

### 2021 Lund University: Bachelor Thesis

Our bachelor thesis consisted in analyzing the performance of various machine learning models on the prediction of local minimums and maximums in the historical price data of stocks in the S&P 500 composite index. The results showed that deep neural networks easily outperformed classical models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN). With the recurrent neural network ‚ÄúLong short-term memory‚Äù (LSTM) coming out on top.

### 2021 Lund University: Project leader in the course ‚ÄúSoftware development for large projects‚Äù

One of the courses I took during my studies was software development for large projects. A team consisting of 20 students had to develop a system for a fictional client. My role was that of the project leader. This entailed scheduling and holding meetings, making high level decisions and delegating work to the two subgroups; development and testing. Although client satisfaction was the top priority, I also prioritized making sure that everybody in the team was happy and productive. We managed to deliver a fully functioning system and the client was satisfied.

### 2021 Lund University & Fenix Solar:

One of the courses I took during my studies was simply called ‚ÄúProject 3rd year‚Äù. The goal of this course was to create and deliver a piece of software to a company in the private sector. My group had the pleasure to work with Fenix Solar - a new startup with the mission to make owning solar panels hassle free. Fenix Solar needed a platform on which the staff and external contractors could monitor the performance of the clients‚Äô photovoltaic system. The project model chosen was scrum and my role was that of the technical leader. My contribution was the frontend javascript, the python backend and database.
