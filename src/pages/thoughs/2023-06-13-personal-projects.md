If you are a software developer or studying to become one, I cannot recommend you enough to start a side project.

It does not have to be anything fancy or ambitious. It just needs to be your little digital garden where you put in some hours a week. It will be your safe place where you can just enjoy writing the code you want to write. Use the frameworks and code style you want use.

To the question, "what should the project be about?", there is a simple answer. It does not matter. It could literally be about anything. Just pick the first idea and go with it.
