_You do not need a [dumbphone](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dumbphone). You just need a phone without social media._

Trading a smartphone for a dumbphone sends you back to the 90's. One looses a great camera, speakers, screen and most importantly useful apps such as banking and digital ID. One might gain better battery life.

Rip the band-aid off, **just uninstall the apps that are bothering you.**
